This project involves building an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to help HR departments make data-driven decisions. The report visualizes key HR metrics such as employee headcount, 
attrition rate, department-wise distribution, average tenure, gender diversity, and performance ratings. Data transformations were done using Power Query, and DAX measures were created for dynamic KPIs.
